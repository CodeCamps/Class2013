Monkey Man 3000
===============

The final class project.

A side scroller, similar to Super Mario Bros., with modern graphics. Supports one or two players.

Hero is a monkey that’s trying to rescue baby monkeys that have been captured by other animals in the zoo. After rescuing the babies, the hero faces the Zoo Keeper before escaping to the outside world.

Player Abilities:

1. Jump
1. Double Jump (Wall Jump?)
1. Use tail to swing
1. Use tail to attack (spin or flip to lash enemy)
1. Flings poo at enemies

Player starts with three health. Player collects bananas for points. Every 100th banana restores a health point (when not at full health). Some bananas are in bunches and are randomly worth between 5 and 15 bananas.

Levels are themed. Hero works his way past minions to boss at end of level. Along the way, baby monkeys are freed from cages, then run off the screen. When the boss is defeated, the player gets a key to enter the next level.

Level Themes:

- Rocks: Boss is gorilla, minions are lemurs.
- Aviary: Boss is falcon, minions are flamingoes.
- Plains: Boss is giraffe, minions are zebras.
- Swamp: Boss is alligator, minions are turtles (TMNT reference here?).
- Jungle: Boss is lion, minions are lynxes.
- Arctic: Boss is polar bear, minions are penguins.

In the final level, the hero works his way through the zoo grounds. Boss is zookeeper, minions are zoo workers and concession vendors. Boss is scrawny, but once he’s defeated he rips his shirt off and is very muscular. You have to battle (a stronger version of) him again to escape the zoo and complete the game.

Notes:

- The title screen should be interactive. A mini-game that you can play before you actually press start. Perhaps you’re a caged monkey flinging poo at passersby?
- The placeholder art is from the web. Final game will include original assets exclusively.
